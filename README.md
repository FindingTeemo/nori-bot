# nori-bot
A Discord bot I created for a trivia server. It's main purpose is to create polls with reactions to organize server roles more efficiently and to keep track of game/payout history. There are also commands to calculate the Scrabble score or Words With Friends score of any string for faster answer sharing on specific questions.
